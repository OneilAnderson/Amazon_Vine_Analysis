# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
 In this analysis, we use our knowledge in PySpark to analyze if there is any bias towards the Vine program regarding their reviews. We used the data and charts that we analyzed previously to determine the differences between the paid and unpaid reviews in the program.

## Summary

We can notice that there is a higher percentage of unpaid five star reviews , which is around 45 percent. From this analysis, I do not believe that there is a positivity bias. Another way we could analyze this theory is through further statistical analysis, such as analyzing the information in a box and whiskers plot.
